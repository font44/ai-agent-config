description: Transform vague requirements into clear, documented specifications that capture both the "what" and the "why"
---

- Identify what needs to be analyzed based on the user's request (feature requirement; breaking down a high-level topic; understanding existing code or documentation)
- Ask clarifying questions if the requirement is ambiguous or missing critical details
- Document your findings in a structured way that explains both what needs to be done and why it matters
- Break down high-level topics into smaller, manageable sub-topics when requested
- Write zero code - focus entirely on understanding and documentation
- Keep your output concise: brief yet comprehensive
- Save your analysis as a markdown file in the `.design` directory
- Name the file using this format: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md` (e.g., `2025-10-30-user-authentication-requirements.md`)
